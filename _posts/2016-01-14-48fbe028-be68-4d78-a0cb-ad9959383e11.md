WHY AUSTRALIA NEEDS SPORTLYNK:

Australia's largest online sporting and fitness community.

Find, Book and Participate. It brides the gap, bringing it together in one, easy to use platform. Anyone can engage in an active pursuit anywhere in Australia......Its anyone's game.

"Access to sport and recreation facilities at a community level is an integral part of maintaining a healthy lifestyle for everyone, both in urban and rural communities. Sport and recreation opportunities provide settings for social interaction, sharing common interests and enhancing a sense of community."

We know that Australians are increasingly playing sport or engaging in activities to get fit rather than getting fit to play sport. We also know that sport is incredibly social and is a great way to meet people. Sport in Australia is a religion and is idolised - Australia loves sport. It has a lifestyle element and a cultural self identity and a form of self expression and individualism. Its everybody's game. It transcends, age, sex gender, creed and culture and we have to be innovative to capture the hearts and minds of people with creative ways to change the way we engage in sports and activities. The cost to engage in sport and fitness pursuits is increasing so we must look to new ways to overcome this.

Social pressures are influencing participation. Weight management, social interaction and enjoyment are common motivators. A growing trend is the use of social media to build and foster sporting communities through which people can engage in sport and communicate sporting preferences to a wider audience (CSIRO Report page 11).

"Sport has the power to unite people in a way little else can. Sport can create  
hope. Breaks down racial barriers ... laughs in the face of discrimination ...  
speaks to people in a language they can understand."  
- Nelson Mandela

Cultural, artistic, recreational, sporting activities and voluntary work enrich  
people's lives and improve their connections with the wider community.  
International research shows that increasing community participation in  
organised sport and recreation contributes to what is known as "social capital",  
which is the "social fabric, or glue" that ties members together in a given  
locality (Cox, 1995). According to Putnam (2000) sports clubs and community  
organisations are important conduits for developing such capital and are good  
barometers of community strength.

Sport and recreation provides the catalyst for community gatherings, from small functions to major events, where people play, talk and share experiences. Importantly, it has a positive effect that reaches many levels of our society. It is an important thread that ties our social fabric.

The beneficial effects on social cohesion, educational outcomes for young people, and the positive impacts on physical and mental wellbeing which flow from participation in organised sport and recreation is particularly important in regional areas, where it has always been one of the main cohesive elements that draw people together. At a time when regional communities are under  
pressure, the value of sport and recreation becomes even more important.  
In most regional and remote communities, it is the local tennis, football or basketball club that provides and sustains community interaction (Kemp, 2006). Atherley (2006) identified other research that recognised the following flow-on effects -- social ties, power relations and social capital, social  
networks, community integration, flow of information and creating a sense of belonging.

Sporting and recreational activities and events contribute to the development of stronger social networks and more cohesive communities -- for participants, volunteers and supporters. They provide opportunities for social engagement;  
often creating awareness and acceptance of differences between individuals and communities.

Bringing people together through sport and recreation boosts confidence through times of prosperity. Sport and recreation galvanises communities in times of need. This is especially evident in rural communities, where traditional  
Saturday sports such as football and netball are the glue that bonds the community; often acting as the main community social event for the week.

Baum (2000) found sport and recreation makes significant social, economic, cultural and environmental contributions to the life of rural communities.  
Dempsey (1999) highlighted the importance of sport in his 17-year study of a Victorian rural community. His study found that sport and sporting clubs enabled all members of a community to be linked by a common bond: their  
participation in that club. Similarly, Mahoney (as cited in Townsend, et al., 2002) found in a study of two small Victorian rural communities  
that at a times of economic hardship, when other institutions and structures were disappearing, physical activity and organised sporting clubs remained, providing a focus within the communities and a sense of community cohesion.  
Valuable social networks develop through shared sporting experiences and aspirations.

For many, forming friendships and a sense of belonging are powerful reasons why they become involved and remain active in sport. Access to social support consistently emerges in research as a factor influencing participation in  
physical activity (Stahl et al., 2001).

A 2002 study in Western Australia showed "more than half of the respondents participate in physical activity with another person, providing further evidence that social support is an important factor in decisions about being physically  
active" (McCormack, et al., 2003).

Generally, places with high levels of social capital are safer, better governed and more prosperous, compared to those places with low levels of social capital (Putnam, 2000). There are signs that sport can help reduce the crime rate. For example, in the US, cities that adopted midnight basketball leagues experienced sharper decreases in property crime  
than other cities (Hartmann & Depro, 2006).
